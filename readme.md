# Farm Tracking Program

## Design Proposal: Farm Tracking App

**Name:** FarmTrack

### Design Overview
FarmTrack is a comprehensive farm management app designed to streamline and automate various aspects of crop and livestock management, inventory management, financial tracking, compliance, market and sales, record keeping, and weather monitoring. The application aims to assist farmers in optimizing their operations, improving productivity, and making informed decisions based on analyzed data. The application identifies problems based on many different environmental factors such as soil pH, rainfall, temperature/season, and soil arability and then provides solutions to these problems like fertilizer use, irrigation, and soil neutralization. The program is meant to be linked to hardware to automate data entry.

### Key Features and Functionalities

#### Crop Management
- Optimize soil health and minimize disease risk (maintaining soil pH around 5.8 - 6.4).
- Set reminders and track planting and harvesting dates for different crops.
- Create customized irrigation schedules based on crop water requirements and weather conditions.
- Record and track fertilizer and pesticide applications, including dosage and frequency.
- Monitor soil health parameters such as nutrient levels, pH, and organic matter content.
- Track crop yields and analyze performance to identify trends and improve productivity.

#### Livestock Management
- Maintain digital health records for individual animals, including vaccinations.
- Track breeding and reproduction data, including pregnancy status.
- Record feed types and quantities for different animal diets.
- Monitor milk production volumes.
- Keep track of livestock numbers, ages, weights, and farm capacity.

#### Inventory Management
- Monitor seed and crop inventory levels, set alerts for low stock, and manage procurement.
- Track livestock inventory, including births, deaths, purchases, and sales.
- Monitor feed and fertilizer stock levels and generate purchase orders when needed.
- Track sales of crops, livestock, and other farm products while maintaining up-to-date stock levels.

#### Financial Management
- Record and categorize farm expenses, set budgets, and track expenditure.
- Monitor farm income from sales, subsidies, and other revenue sources.
- Generate profit and loss statements to assess the financial health of the farm.
- Track cash flow, including inflows and outflows, to ensure efficient financial management.

#### Weather Forecast and Alerts
- Analyze climate patterns and trends to optimize crop planting and irrigation planning.
- Suggest optimal irrigation schedules based on real-time weather conditions.

#### Market and Sales
- Maintain customer and supplier databases for easy communication and order management.
- Track sales orders from placement to fulfillment and delivery.
- Manage product catalogs, set prices, and update pricing information.
- Generate sales reports and analyze sales performance.
- Provide insights into market trends and forecast demand to assist in decision-making.

#### Record Keeping and Documentation
- Maintain a centralized repository for storing and retrieving historical farm data for future reference and analysis.

#### Tracking
- Implement a pricing algorithm that dynamically calculates prices for crops based on market fluctuations.
